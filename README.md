# Timeline View

Display your obsidian notes in a timeline, based on a given property.

Should match Obsidian's graph view design as closely as possible.

## Features

### Property
Type the name of the property you'd like to use to order the notes.  "created" will order the notes based on the time they were created, "modified" will order them based on the time they were modified.  Any other property name can be used.  If a given note does not have the property, it will default to `0`.

### Names below points
Toggle if you'd like to see the names of notes below their point on the timeline.  This is off by default, as any notes that are close together may overlap.
